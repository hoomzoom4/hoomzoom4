- **Hardware Selection**: Chose the Ryzen 3 3200G and GTX 1030 for their value and performance.
- **Performance Tuning**: Overclocked RAM to achieve higher speeds, enhancing overall system performance.
- **Windows Optimization**: Applied system tweaks for optimal performance while maintaining system security.

**Cybersecurity Integration**:

- **BIOS Security**: Enabled BIOS password and secure boot features to protect against unauthorized firmware-level modifications.
- **Operating System Hardening**: Configured Windows Group Policy settings to limit unnecessary services and reduce the attack surface.
- **Software Updates**: Ensured all system drivers and the operating system were up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.

### Second Build: Enhanced Performance with Advanced Security ($600 in 2021)

- **BIOS Configuration**: Adjusted settings for stability and performance.
- **File Systems**: Selected file systems that offer better security features and data integrity.
- **SSD Technology**: Chose an NVMe M.2 SSD for its speed and encryption capabilities.

**Cybersecurity Integration**:

- **Full Disk Encryption**: Enabled BitLocker on the NVMe SSD to secure data at rest, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
- **Network Security**: Configured the system to use VPNs and proxies for secure internet browsing and online gaming, safeguarding against eavesdropping and cyber attacks.
- **Antivirus Protection**: Installed and configured robust antivirus software to provide real-time protection against malware and other cyber threats.

### Third Build: High-Performance System with Cybersecurity Focus ($450 in 2024)

- **Component Selection**: Carefully selected used parts for their reliability and performance.
- **Overclocking**: Achieved higher clock speeds on RAM and CPU while ensuring system stability.
- **System Optimization**: Applied advanced settings for peak performance without compromising security.

**Cybersecurity Integration**:

- **Component Integrity**: Vetted used components for any signs of tampering or hardware-based threats, such as firmware implants. (Also used a completely new SSD)
- **System Hardening**: Configured the operating system with strict user account controls and disabled unnecessary services to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Network Configuration**: Set up the system with a firewall and also even stricter antivirus settings. To add to this, I used browsers with better safety features like Brave Browser

### Conclusion

The process of building these three gaming PCs has not only honed my skills in hardware selection and performance optimization but also in implementing cybersecurity measures to protect the systems. From BIOS security to full disk encryption and secure network practices, each build incorporated elements that are essential in the field of cybersecurity. These experiences reflect my dedication to understanding the complexities of secure computing and my suitability for the Poly Cyber Work-Learn Scheme by the Digital and Intelligence Service.
