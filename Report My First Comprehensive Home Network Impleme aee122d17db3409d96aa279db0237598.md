# Report: My First Comprehensive Home Network Implementation

### Introduction

**Objective**: To design and implement a secure and efficient home network that provides comprehensive coverage and high-speed internet access across a two-level residence.

**Context**: The project was initiated to address the connectivity needs of a modern household with multiple users and devices, (includes a home office for father that WFH and brother with gaming station) ensuring seamless operation for both professional and personal use.

### Network Design and Implementation

### Network Topology

- **Core Devices**: TP-Link Deco X20 Router, Modem, Optical Network Terminal (ONT)
- **Connectivity**: UGREEN Cat 6 Ethernet Cable, Wireless connections
- **Peripheral Devices**: TV, Laptop, Desktop, Printer
- **Services**: Cloud Storage (Google Drive), Internet (ViewQwest)
- **Network Security**: WPA3 encryption, TP-Link HomeCare

The Level 1 network topology was designed to serve as the backbone of the home network, with the primary router strategically placed to optimize signal distribution. Wired connections were established (mainly for desktops) using high-quality UGREEN Cat 6 Ethernet cables to ensure gigabit-speed connectivity and reduce latency for more network-demanding devices.

Level 2 was configured to extend the network's reach, ensuring that no area of the residence suffered weak signal strength. The mesh network topology facilitated seamless roaming and consistent coverage throughout the floor.

### Network Security Measures

The network was fortified with the latest security protocols, including WPA3 encryption, to protect against unauthorized access and potential cyber threats. The TP-Link HomeCare suite provided additional features such as parental controls, antivirus protection, and quality of service (QoS) prioritization, enhancing the overall security posture of the home network.

### Performance Analysis

A basic Wi-Fi heatmap analysis was done post-implementation to check the network's performance. The analysis done by software confirmed excellent signal strength and coverage across all levels, with no detectable dead zones. Then, I manually tested the network's throughput were tested under different load scenarios, and there was stability and reliability.

### Conclusion

The project showcases my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, ensuring both functionality and security. Successful deployment of this home network stands as a testament to my technical acumen in the fields of networking.  I am confident that this experience, along with my dedication to continuous learning, makes me an ideal candidate for the Poly Cyber Work-Learn Scheme by the Digital and Intelligence Service.
